# KitaMOVE - Vite + React Frontend

This repository contains the front-end code for the KitaMOVE website, built with Vite and React.

## About The Project

KitaMOVE is an all-in-one moving platform where users can search for lorry and house rentals in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Danilismail30/KitaMOVE.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd KitaMOVE
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Next Steps

From here, you can start developing your application:
*   **Create Components:** Break down the UI in `src/App.jsx` into individual component files inside a `src/components` directory.
*   **Add Routing:** Use a library like `react-router-dom` to create different pages.
*   **Fetch Data:** Connect to your backend API to get real data for house and lorry listings.
